 * kth last node in a singly linked list
 *
 * Different approaches:
 * 1. Get the length of the list. let that be n. traverse n-k nodes, to get the answer.
 * 2. Forward pointer , slow pointer. Let the forward pointer traverse k nodes. After that , let both pointers
 * traverse one node at a time. When the forward pointer reaches the last node, the slow pointer will be at the kth last node
 * 3. Recursive method.
 *
 * Assume it is an integer Linkedlist
